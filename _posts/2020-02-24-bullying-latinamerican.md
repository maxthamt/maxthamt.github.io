title: Bullying in Latin American schools
subtitle: Bar chart based in PISA data, #SWDChallenge

My bar chart for the February #SWDChallange addresses the topic of bullying in Latin American schools using PISA 2018 data. The idea was to make it interactive, so the user could explore two layers of information: the frequency of the reported bullying (at least once a month vs at least once a year), and the differences across countries.

I tried to do the chart using D3 first, and I managed to create the static version, but when I tried to apply the "update" pattern with the filtered data it broke. So I moved on Tableau, to analyze the data, arrange the main ideas and try different layouts.

After a few iterations, I got to this version:

<div class="mcb-wrap-inner"><div class="column mcb-column mcb-item-ny8ost4q1 one column_column"><div class="column_attr clearfix" style=""><center><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/BullyingLat/Bullying?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="800" height="940" frameborder="0"></iframe></center></div></div></div>
